# Assembly_Code_Translation_NLP
Translate the cross-architectural assembly code, e.g. from arm to x86, with NLP-based models. Encoder-Attention-Decoder structure is adopted in this project to fit in with various sequence length. Encoder and decoder unit are both implemented in three different NLP models, which are SimpleRNN, LSTM, and GRU. The pre-trained GRU-based model can achieve 93% of accuracy and great translation efficiency.
